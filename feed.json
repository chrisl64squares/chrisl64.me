But I'm an excellent educator and learning designer with a passion for chess. \n\nThrough a combination of my own experience, exploration of pedagogy[^pedant] and research, and synthesizing the advice, regimens, and recommendations of a host of chess coaches, players, and improvers, I've put together solid approaches for adult chess improvers[^aci].\n\nOver the next few days[^orweeksor], I'll be sharing some different techniques, tools, sites, and apps for tactics training for three different[^overlaps] purposes:\n\n1. Pattern Recognition\n2. Calculation\n3. Visualization\n\nWhile these will necessarily contain some idiosyncratic choices, they will together provide solid, specific answers to some of the most common questions about tactics training.\n\nThere is almost no question that tactics training is at the heart of any chess improvement program, though arguments about the specific proportion of time one should spend will never be settled[^edresearch]. I'm focused on enjoyment and chess as a support for positive mental health, so not particularly interested in those debates...and they are largely irrelevant to what I will be sharing anyway!\n\n[^minischeme]: In the minuscule scheme of things, for that matter!\n\n[^pedant]: Most often, if one wants to be pedantic about it, *andragogy*, but in practice practically everyone uses \"pedagogy\" to refer to the art and science of teaching both children and adults.\n\n[^aci]: There's been a marked increase in resistance to, and complaints about, the term \"adult chess improver\" lately. I'm not one of those folks. If you are, substitute whatever term makes sense to you.\n\n[^orweeksor]: Ideally. It could be the next few weeks or even months.\n\n[^overlaps]: Naturally, there will be a fair amount of overlap.\n\n[^edresearch]: Such are the vagaries of education research, in general, and the paucity of research into chess improvement, specifically.\n",
