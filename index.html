<p>The Capablanca book I most want to get my hands on is <em>Capablanca&rsquo;s Best Games</em>. Specifically, the new (1997) edition edited, revised, and expanded by the illustrious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Nunn">John Nunn</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, the few (used) copies are expensive, and I&rsquo;ve promised myself (and my long-suffering partner) to curb my book habit a little bit.</p>
<p>Books about Capablanca vary a great deal in quality, even more than usual. You&rsquo;ll find many details on the problems (and successes) of various Capa books in <a href="https://www.chesshistory.com/">Edward Winter&rsquo;s</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> write-up &ldquo;<a href="https://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/capablanca.html">Capablanca Goes Algebraic</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>In addition to being a brilliant chess player, peaking at world #9, and one of our best chess writers today, Nunn went to Oxford at 15, becoming its youngest graduate in more than 450 years. Oh, and then went on to get a PhD in mathematics, studying &ldquo;finite H-spaces&rdquo; (whatever those are).&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>If you have any interest in chess history, chess books, and chess writing&mdash;or just enjoy when someone armed with serious research skills and facts at his disposal takes down chess authors who appear to have neither&mdash;you owe it to yourself to delve into Winter&rsquo;s site (and get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Winter_(chess_historian)#Books">his books</a>). It&rsquo;s a true treasure trove.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Yesterday I shared <a href="https://chrisl64.me/2024/11/05/lautierbologan.html">a puzzle</a> I learned about via one of John Nunn&rsquo;s books.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://dgriffinchess.wordpress.com/">Douglas Griffin</a>&mdash;translator extraordinaire, man of a million photos, and apparent possessor of a photographic memory&mdash;shared <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GbiHgbcbgAAK5lS?format=jpg">a cool photo of Ljubomir &ldquo;Ljubo&rdquo; Ljubojević in action against Mikhail Tal</a> in the 1979 Interzonal tournament in Riga.</p>
<p>The picture prompted me to look through my sprawl of notes and I found the interesting position depicted above, which I&rsquo;d stumbled across in <a href="https://chesstempo.com/">Chess Tempo</a> many years (practically a lifetime) ago. The puzzle position comes from a game featuring Ljubo who, walking on a knife&rsquo;s edge, finding a brilliant sequence that definitively nailed down the win against Mihail Marin in the <a href="https://www.365chess.com/tournaments/Szirak_Interzonal_1987/20447">1987 Interzonal tournament</a> in Szirak, Hungary. Can you spot what Ljubo did<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>? And did you (ahem) discover the hidden point of that first, completely non-intuitive (to this patzer), move<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the funny thing: the top three in this tournament would advance&mdash;along with six more from two other Interzonals&mdash;to matches which would ultimately decide who would face the winner of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship_1987">1987 Kasparov-Karpov World Chess Championship</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Ljubo placed a respectable 7th (out of eighteen), but a playoff was required to determine the third coveted spot. A playoff between Lajos Portisch and none other than&hellip;John Nunn! Sadly for residents of the Nunn Nation of Nunnistan<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, Portisch won two straight games to send Nunn home.</p>
<p>I love these kinds of unexpected, serendipitous connections.</p>

<p>To me, this seems a bit exaggerated. I remember that as a kid I found similar statements in many of the opening monographies of the ’80s, the ’70s and even of the ’50s.

<p>White found an <em>amazing</em> resource to save this game. Can you find it?</p>
<p>This is one of the many excellent positions found in John Nunn&rsquo;s book <a href="http://www.gambitbooks.com/books/Learn_Chess_Tactics.html"><em>Learn Chess Tactics</em></a>. Here&rsquo;s how he describes the puzzle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;White is a piece down for one pawn, and his threats on the kingside appear to have come to nothing. Indeed, if Black were now given a free tempo to play &hellip;Rg8 then White would be facing inevitable defeat. All this means that if White is going to try something, then he must do so straight away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s been a long<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> discussion on the Chess Dojo public Discord<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> involving, among many other topics, the perennial favorites of practice and training vis-à-vis playing, aka consolidation of knowledge into skill.</p>
<p>Today, one of the central participants described an acquaintance&rsquo;s &ldquo;problem&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is true [that one&rsquo;s <em>primary</em> reward should be grown, not winning or losing] but playing matters and so if you end up in this container of studying, it becomes relatively more appealing than playing</p>
<p>I say this bc this happened</p>
<p>A guy enjoyed studying more than playing and then didn’t play</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>Like this guy studied good stuff but never wanted to play
If he simply played
Guy would have skyrocketed
And he enjoyed studying for the sake of studying</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>Like when he did play, he demonstrated very clearly that he learned stuff</p>
<p>So it showed up
It’s just he found it stressful
And he had no incentive bc studying by itself was satisfying</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was struck by the rueful tone, describing this poor guy who fell into the trap of enjoying studying and learning as if he&rsquo;d been saddled by an addiction or something.</p>
<p>And I get it! Chess is a game, and the most popular goal for most people with most games is to win<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. But I would argue not only that this isn&rsquo;t the sole goal, but that any emotionally healthy approach to a game <em>necessarily</em> includes enjoyment and fulfillment in addition to<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> winning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with enjoying studying more than playing, even to the exclusion of playing altogether. Chess is a game to be employed in whatever ways make us feel the best. No one reading this is, or is ever going to, rely on chess for their livelihood. My number one question when I see people expressing significant, non-transient anguish over their rating or their lack of progress as measured in wins and losses is: do you enjoy playing? And my number one suggestion, if they do not, is to stop, take a break, and find a different, better<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> game. If the break becomes permanent, that&rsquo;s fine!</p>
<p>Chess players seem particularly prone to persisting in playing a game they&rsquo;ve stopped enjoying. This powers the obsession with ratings, which is the fuel for all kinds of toxic garbage fires, both psychologically and for the community. There are all sorts of reasons for this, many of which exist in other games, but the effect seems more widespread, more painful, and more common than the rest. I suspect this is the hellish confluence of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The explosion of online chess, which has popularized modes of chess that were mere diversions (blitz), if not practically impossible to play (bullet, hyperbullet), for most of its history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The integration of video game mechanics that are particularly suited to those modes, including a baked-in emphasis on ratings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The understandable embrace of chess by video game enthusiasts, and those communities' cultures and expectations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>deeply</em> insinuated (and deeply mistaken) conflation and association of chess skill with general intelligence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s wild to me that despite ratings systems existing for only 15% of the game&rsquo;s long history (and being excellent at just one thing: matchmaking), a chess world without rating<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> is inconceivable to many. I don&rsquo;t mean just the creeping toxicity of the quantification, mistaking the number as a measure of worth (self- and otherwise), or the ratings shaming, or the use of rating as a cudgel or (inaccurate) barometer of accuracy or authority. I don&rsquo;t even mean people mystified by the mechanics of tournaments and other competitions organized without rating as we understand them today. I mean people who are <em>astonished</em> by the notion that people would still play if there weren&rsquo;t a visible, public rating.</p>
<p>At any rate, my point is that all of these things conspire to rob so many people of the pleasure and fulfillment of studying the game, of doing calculation work, solving puzzles, playing over incredible games, mastering an endgame technique, speeding through a tactics set, staring slack-jawed at the beauty of a combination or the mesmerizing geometry of a sequence&hellip;closing, for no good reason, a door that opens onto a whole world of enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s maddening and saddening. Because the truth is altogether simpler: the best path&mdash;the <em>only</em> perfect path&mdash;is the one that satisfies and fulfills <em>you</em>, regardless of how many games you play. And the reverse is true as well: if you <em>only</em> like playing and competition with others, that&rsquo;s great too! Some of the happiest chess players I know are those who just have fun playing (often obscene numbers of games), not caring about their rating other than being happy that the number does its job, matching them with folks with whom they can reasonably compete.</p>
<p>Which isn&rsquo;t to say finding one&rsquo;s own path is simple. I&rsquo;ve fallen prey to this dynamic many times in my life, letting a spirit of competition or level of mastery steal my sunshine from a wide range of pursuits<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s been such a common difficulty in my life that a central point of therapy for me has been finding a way to be a happy amateur at something and not measure my worth by my place in some hierarchy of achievement. But that&rsquo;s the goal, and I can attest there are few things that rival the feeling of finding, and walking, that path.</p>

<p>In the grand scheme of things<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>&mdash;even before losing the ability to visualize&mdash;I&rsquo;ve never been a particularly good chess player. But I&rsquo;m an excellent educator and learning designer with a passion for chess.</p>
<p>Through a combination of my own experience, exploration of pedagogy<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and research, and synthesizing the advice, regimens, and recommendations of a host of chess coaches, players, and improvers, I&rsquo;ve put together solid approaches for adult chess improvers<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Over the next few days<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, I&rsquo;ll be sharing some different techniques, tools, sites, and apps for tactics training for three different<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pattern Recognition</li>
<li>Calculation</li>
<li>Visualization</li>
</ol>
<p>While these will necessarily contain some idiosyncratic choices, they will together provide solid, specific answers to some of the most common questions about tactics training.</p>
<p>There is almost no question that tactics training is at the heart of any chess improvement program, though arguments about the specific proportion of time one should spend will never be settled<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.

<p>A few days ago I joined the <a href="https://www.chessdojo.club/">Chess Dojo</a>. I’ve heard so many good things about it over the last six months that I likely would have joined, despite the fact that the training plans themselves are freely available for anyone to browse and use on their own with a <a href="https://www.chessdojo.club/signup">free account</a>.</p>
<p>First, the three “senseis” are not only highly esteemed members of the chess community, generally, but each are high on my own list of awesome chess folks as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.perpetualchesspod.com/new-blog/2020/4/28/episode-175-gm-jesse-kraai-returns">Jesse Kraai</a> achieved a PhD in Philosophy<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, earned his GM title at the advanced (in chess years) age of 35, and actually stopped playing chess for a three years while he wrote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i456btUkErM"><em>Lisa: A Chess Novel</em></a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@chesscomdpruess">David Pruess</a>, an excellent teacher a mainstay of chess.com video lessons and explainers for years before departing for better climes<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, is an excellent teacher by any measure, but learning he also has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia">aphantasia</a>—but is still a strong IM <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia">who can play blindfold chess</a>—was a key factor in my deciding to play chess again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.perpetualchesspod.com/new-blog/2016/12/27/internation-master-elect-kostya-kavutskiy">Kostya Kavutskiy</a><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> is also an excellent teacher whose presence in the chess world has been quickly growing thanks to his acumen, ability to explain chess in a way mere mortals can understand, and one of the calmest demeanors this side of <a href="https://imrosen.com/">Rosenstan</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, I do love me a structured program that can bring more order to my training and studying, but my reason for joining, rather than just using the plans on my own, is the aspect I’m also the most nervous about: the community. Befitting its name, the Chess Dojo requires<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> sparring, analyzing, playing, and engaging in “post-mortems” with other Dojo members. I’m hoping this part of the program will be the prod I need to overcome my reluctance to actually play in addition to the studying I enjoy so much.</p>
<p>As they say in the Dojo, “Let’s gooooooooo!&quot;</p>

<p>If ever there were a road as long as life itself, it&rsquo;s the game of chess. I learned how the pieces move more than 45 years ago now, and I&rsquo;ve fallen in and out of obsession with the royal game many times since, but the evanescent existence of my hopes of becoming a good player<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> flashed and faded away in just a few short months in the early 90s.</p>
<p>That feeling of failure frustrated me for decades. I rarely stopped following the chess scene or reading about chess history, but I didn&rsquo;t actually play.</p>
<p>Then, after a series of truly unfortunate, life-changing events <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and a long time undergoing various ensuing treatments, I suddenly realized I no longer cared about competition in the same way.</p>
<p>And when I say &ldquo;suddenly,&rdquo; I mean it: I had a moment of profound insight and clarity, my madeleine de Proust not a &ldquo;squat, plump little cake,&rdquo; but instead former Icelandic Chess Federation President Gudmundur Thorarinsson&rsquo;s (too) thin book <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/9789493257474/Match-Time-Story-legendary-1972-9493257479/plp"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Match of All Time<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, peering into me from my nightstand one rainy morning.</p>
<p>For reasons lost along with the turbulent dreams of a fitful sleep, I instantaneously understood it was OK to love chess though I would likely never rise to even the level of being competent at it. Without warning I knew it was just fine to be a fan with no pretense to being a &ldquo;real&rdquo; player. And, most pertinent to this post, I found myself ready—actually a bit desperate—to immerse myself in learning, training, solving puzzles, and occasionally even playing purely for the enjoyment of it. Even better, this newfound equanimity allowed these pursuits to begin to occupy a prominent place in my larger approach to improved mental health and mindfulness.</p>
<p>And that is the long-winded introduction to the genesis of this site: it is a place where I will share my love of the greatest game<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> in whatever way feels right, including practical items like puzzles, resources, thoughts about events past and present, and notes about my training progress, but also my unique(ish) approach to chess as a means of improved emotional well-being in the face of unrelenting chronic depression and PTSD<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
